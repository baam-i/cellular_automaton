# Cellular Automaton Simulator
This project is an interactive Cellular Automaton Simulator built with ```Python``` and ```Pygame```.
It visually represents a grid-based world where each cell can be either alive or dead, evolving over time according to configurable rules such as the classic *Conway’s Game of Life pattern* (“23/3”).

Users can draw directly on the grid by clicking cells, start and pause the simulation, clear the world, and save or load custom patterns stored as ```.cgl``` files.

This project serves as both an educational tool and a creative playground to explore the fascinating behavior of emergent systems and self-organization in cellular automata.
